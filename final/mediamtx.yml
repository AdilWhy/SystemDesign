# Variant of the HLS protocol to use. Available options are:
# * mpegts - uses MPEG-TS segments, for maximum compatibility.
# * fmp4 - uses fragmented MP4 segments, more efficient.
# * lowLatency - uses Low-Latency HLS.

# Number of HLS segments to keep on the server.

hlsSegmentCount: 7
# Minimum duration of each segment.
# A player usually puts 3 segments in a buffer before reproducing the stream.
# The final segment duration is also influenced by the interval between IDR frames,

# in each segment.
hlsSegmentDuration: 1s
# Minimum duration of each part.
# A player usually puts 3 parts in a buffer before reproducing the stream.
# Parts are used in Low-Latency HLS in place of segments.
# Part duration is influenced by the distance between video/audio samples
# and is adjusted in order to produce segments with a similar duration.

# Path settings

# Settings in "paths" are applied to specific paths, and the map key
# is the name of the path.
# Any setting in "pathDefaults" can be overridden here.
# It's possible to use regular expressions by using a tilde as prefix,
# for example "~^(test1|test2)$" will match both "test1" and "test2",
# for example "~^prefix" will match all paths that start with "prefix".
